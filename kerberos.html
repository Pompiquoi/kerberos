        <h2>What is Kerberos?</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Kerberos</strong> is a secure, robust network authentication protocol designed to provide
            strong authentication for client-server applications. It was developed at the Massachusetts
            Institute of
            Technology (MIT)
            and named after the three-headed dog from Greek mythology, symbolizing its role in guarding the
            gateway to
            secure resources.
        </p>

        <h3>Key Features of Kerberos</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mutual Authentication:</strong> Ensures that both the client and the server are verified during
                communication.</li>
            <li><strong>Ticket-based Authentication:</strong> Replaces passwords with temporary tickets, reducing
                exposure to sensitive credentials.</li>
            <li><strong>Centralized Authentication:</strong> Uses a Key Distribution Center (KDC) to manage
                authentication centrally.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Platform Independence:</strong> Works seamlessly across various platforms, such as Linux,
                Windows, and macOS.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Single Sign-On (SSO):</strong> Allows users to authenticate once and access multiple services
                without re-entering credentials.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How Kerberos Works</h3>
        <p>
            Kerberos operates using a ticket-granting mechanism and a trusted third party (the KDC). Here's an overview
            of the workflow:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Authentication Request</strong>: The client sends a request to the KDC to authenticate,
                providing their credentials.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Ticket-Granting Ticket (TGT)</strong>: If the credentials are valid, the KDC sends back a Ticket
                Granting Ticket (TGT) encrypted with the KDC's secret key.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Service Ticket Request</strong>: The client uses the TGT to request a service ticket for a
                specific resource.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Service Ticket</strong>: The KDC issues a service ticket, allowing the client to access the
                requested
                resource.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Access the Resource</strong>: The client presents the service ticket to the server, which grants
                access.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Benefits of Kerberos</h3>
        <p>
            Kerberos offers significant advantages for secure authentication:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Eliminates the need to transmit passwords over the network.</li>
            <li>Supports modern encryption techniques for secure communication.</li>
            <li>Scales well in enterprise environments with thousands of users.</li>
            <li>Ensures compatibility with various operating systems and applications.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Real-World Use Cases</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Enterprise Authentication</strong>: Large organizations use Kerberos for centralized
                authentication to
                multiple services like file servers, email systems, and databases.</li>
            <li><strong>Web Applications</strong>: Kerberos can be integrated with web servers to provide secure
                authentication for users and applications.(Like on vsb websites)</li>
            <li><strong>Cloud Services</strong>: Many cloud environments support Kerberos to enable secure user
                authentication.</li>
